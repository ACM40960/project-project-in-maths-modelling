# Animal Image Recognition under Night Conditions

## 1. Introduction

Wildlife image recognition plays a crucial role in biodiversity monitoring and conservation research. Although some models, such as YOLO, can accurately recognize animals like cats and dogs in well-lit conditions, their performance declines significantly when image quality is poor--such as when there are shadows or low lighting. 

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can classify animal species in night-vision wildlife images. The goal is to improve recognition accuracy under challenging conditions and support automated monitoring systems.
